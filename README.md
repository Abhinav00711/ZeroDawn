## 📖 Introduction

In today's digital age, the integrity and transparency of voting systems are paramount. Traditional voting systems often face challenges such as tampering, lack of transparency, and security vulnerabilities. Our project aims to address these issues by leveraging blockchain technology to create a decentralized voting system that is secure, transparent, and anonymous.

## 📝 Problem Statement

### 🔍 Transparency & Immutability

In traditional voting systems, voters may doubt the legitimacy of their votes, leading to concerns about tampering and falsified results. By utilizing blockchain, votes can be tallied and stored on an immutable public ledger. This ensures that votes are tracked and counted transparently, allowing everyone to see live records of the number of votes coming in. This transparency fosters trust in the voting process.

### 🛡️ Security

Current voting systems are susceptible to hacks due to insufficient security mechanisms, allowing malicious actors to alter outcomes. A blockchain-based decentralized voting system ensures that all votes are verified as soon as voting concludes, guaranteeing accurate counting and reducing the risk of manipulation.

### 🕵️ Anonymity

Voters expect privacy and may not want others to know their choices. Blockchain technology allows for anonymity in voting. Similar to transactions on the blockchain, voters can use their private keys to keep their identities and choices confidential.

## 🚧 Challenges We Ran Into

- **⏳ Time Constraints**: We managed to complete the entire proof of concept (PoC) within the limited time provided.
- **🔗 Front-end and Back-end Integration**: Integrating the front-end with the back-end was challenging due to the steep learning curve of the Django framework.
- **📚 Limited Library Functionalities**: We encountered a lack of functionalities provided by existing libraries. To overcome this, we developed the required functionalities from scratch.

## 💻 Technologies Used

### Front-end

- 🌐 **HTML**
- 🎨 **CSS**
- 🅱️ **Bootstrap**

### Back-end

- 🐍 **Python**
- 🌐 **Django Framework**
- 🗄️ **SQLite Database**

### Development Tools

- 📓 **Jupyter Notebook**

## ✨ Features

- **Immutable Ledger**: All votes are recorded on a blockchain ledger that cannot be altered.
- **Real-Time Transparency**: Live tracking of votes to ensure transparency during the voting process.
- **Secure Verification**: Votes are verified instantly after voting ends to ensure correct tallying.
- **Anonymity**: Voters can maintain their privacy using private keys.
